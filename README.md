# Git for me

## What?
Git for me is a tool in development by me that aims to track Data, Analytics, and insights provided by github all in one place.
This tool also plans to expand on the metrics provided by github to provide more valuable information to users.

## Why?
To keep it simple, I don't remember the last time that i've tried to access information about mine or any organization
that I belonged usage on github. It's not that github doesn't provide useful data, it's just that it's 
not as easily accessible as it should be. I want to change that.

## Primary tools being used
* Nodejs
* express
* mongo/mongoose
* pug

# How to run
Inside the current directory
```
npm install
npm run start
```
